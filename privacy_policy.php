                        is why you need to enter your unique login username and password each time you want to access
                        your account information. Do help us protect your privacy by maintaining the secrecy of the

                    <h4>Aadhaar user consent policy</h4>
                    <p>The act of providing your Aadhaar is voluntary in nature, which will only be required for
                        completing
                        your account opening procedure online and for digitally signing the account opening form. Your
                        Aadhaar may also be used as a proof of address as an alternative choice to drivers license or
                        Passport copy, which is a voluntary decision to be made by you. You may alternatively choose to
                        go
                        through the offline route of account opening by physically signing all such account opening
                        documents, which does not require you to share your Aadhaar information at all.</p>
